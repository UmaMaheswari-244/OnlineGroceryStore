# 🛒 Online Grocery Store

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In today’s busy world, many people prefer buying groceries online as it saves time and effort. However, most small grocery shops don’t have an online system, which limits their reach and customer base. Customers often face challenges like:

- Waiting in long queues at stores  
- Limited store opening hours  
- Unclear product availability  
- Difficulty comparing prices or offers  

Shop owners also face issues like manually handling large customer orders, tracking inventory, and managing billing and delivery efficiently. These problems reduce customer satisfaction and make operations more difficult.
